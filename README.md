# Twitter Fetcher
A useless app that allows you to fetch a recent tweet leveraging the Twitter API and the Tweepy module, styled using Bootstrap. Created to test different scopes of the Twitter's Developer API.

# Installation
Clone the repository using 
```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/agamjolly/twitter-fetcher.git
```
then use 
```bash 
cd <path to the clone repo>
```
Since the app comes with its own `lib` files, you will not need to separately install any requirements. You can then use
```bash 
flask run
```
once you're in the directory. The app would be live on `localhost:5000` unless specified otherwise.
